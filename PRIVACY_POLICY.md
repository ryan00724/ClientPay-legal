## Privacy Policy
Last updated: 20/08/25

This Privacy Policy explains how ClientPay (“we”, “us”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application (the “Service”).

By using the Service, you agree to this Policy.

### 1. What We Collect
- App data you enter: client names, invoice details, reminders.
- Device and usage data: basic diagnostics (errors in-app), device type/OS version, language, time zone.
- Purchase metadata: product identifiers, receipts, and entitlements managed by Apple/Google and RevenueCat. We do not receive full payment card details.
- Support communications: your email and messages when you contact us.

We do not use analytics SDKs or crash-reporting SDKs in the app.

### 2. How We Use Information
- Provide and improve the Service.
- Manage subscriptions/entitlements.
- Show local reminders/notifications you schedule.
- Respond to support requests.
- Comply with legal obligations and prevent misuse.

### 3. Storage and Transfers
- Your invoice and client data are stored locally on your device (AsyncStorage). We do not run an account system or automatically upload your data to our servers.
- If you enable AI features, you may choose to send prompt text to:
  - Your own server at a configured endpoint (`API_BASE_URL`) to generate messages; or
  - OpenAI’s API only if you explicitly add your own key in development. We recommend keeping the in-app OpenAI key empty for production.
  When used, the prompt content and minimal metadata are transmitted to those services under their privacy terms.

### 4. Notifications
- The app uses local notifications via Expo’s `expo-notifications` to remind you of invoice events. No push device tokens are collected or sent to a server.

### 5. Sharing
We may share information with:
- Service providers (e.g., RevenueCat) under appropriate agreements.
- App stores and payment processors for purchases.
- Authorities when required by law.
We do not sell your personal information.

### 6. Data Retention
- Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
- Purchase/entitlement data is retained by app stores/RevenueCat per their policies.
- Support emails are retained as needed to address your request.

### 7. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port your information, or object/restrict processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.

### 8. Security
We employ reasonable technical and organizational measures. No method is 100% secure.

### 9. Children
Not directed to children under 13 (or higher age as required by local law). If we learn a child provided information, we will delete it.

### 10. Changes
We may update this Policy. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

### 11. Contact
